**Expected Behavior:**
- "Resume Progress" → Continue working on existing book at saved step
- "Start Fresh" / "Start New Book" → Create brand new book entry with new bookId

**Tasks:**
- [x] Identify where resume dialog logic is in ReadyToPublish.tsx (handleStartFresh function)
- [x] Update "Start Fresh" to clear bookId state (setBookId(null))
- [x] Reset all workflow state variables (manuscript, covers, categories, keywords)

- [x] Fix: Frontend captures bookId from response and sets it in state
- [ ] Test: Upload manuscript and verify Save Progress button appears after analysis (manual test required)

- [ ] Verify button code exists in Books.tsx lines 266-276
- [ ] Check if published site is using a different Books component
- [ ] Investigate CDN/deployment caching issue
- [ ] Find solution to force cache clear on published site


### Critical Bug: Delete Button Not Appearing - RESOLVED ✅
**Issue:** Delete button code was in Books.tsx but not showing on /books page even after multiple publishes
